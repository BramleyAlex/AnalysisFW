# Welcome to AnalysisFW!

AnalysisFW allows you to run a particle physics analysis. The input datasets must be stored in a ROOT TTree.

AnalysisFW can:
* Produce histograms of physics observables.
* Produce a subset of ntuples.
* Run user-configurable MVA inference.
* Apply a user-configurable re-weighting to the events.

The following packages are required to run the framework:

* [ROOT ](https://root.cern)
* [Python3 ](https://www.python.org)
* [CMake ](https://cmake.org)
* [BOOST::Python ](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_84_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.html)

The documentation can be found in the [Wiki ](https://github.com/diegobaronm/AnalysisFW/wiki) of this repository.

Have fun!
